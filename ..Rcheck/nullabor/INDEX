box_dist                Distance based on side by side Boxplots for two
                        levels
calc_diff               Uses binned distance to calculate the mean
                        distance between the true plot and the null
                        plots in a lineup. also calculates the mean
                        distance of the null plots among themselves and
                        finds the difference between the mean distance
                        of the true plot and the maximum mean distance
                        of the null plots
