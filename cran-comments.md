# Change of email of maintainer

My email address is now dicook@monash.edu (instead of dicook@iastate.edu). I cannot send an email from dicook@iastate.edu any more to confirm the change of address.

This causes a note on the Win build check. It should be ignored.

# Delay in publishing to CRAN

I am not sure what is taking so long to accept the revision on CRAN. I have been just waiting to receive the acceptance, but have now just checked the ftp list and nullabor doesn't show up in the queue. So I am submitting again.
