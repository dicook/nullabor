# nullabor 0.3.13

- Updated null_lm to optionally compute leverages and standardized residuals.
- Added a new function, lineup_residuals, for creating four different types of lineup plots for residuals with a single line of code.
- Added two new functions, lineup_histograms and lineup_qq for creating lineup histogram and Q-Q plots to assess distributional assumptions.
